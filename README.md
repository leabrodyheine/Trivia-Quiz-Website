# Trivia Quiz Web Application

## Aims

The main aim of this project is to develop a clearly structured font-end single-page web application to practice using APIs for accessing remote services, manipulating JSON and arrays, manipulating the DOM, and incorporating the results into a web application.

## Overview

This Quiz game is a web-based trivia quiz application that presents a sequence of multiple-choice questions to the player. Players select answers with the goal of accruing points for correct responses. The game allows players to quit at any time to retain their score or continue to the next question. Accumulating three incorrect answers results in a loss, with the player's score reset to zero. The application fetches questions from the Open Trivial DB, requiring strategic API endpoint and parameter selection.
